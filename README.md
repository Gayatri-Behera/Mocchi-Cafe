Coffee App - Full-Stack Web Application

Developed a full-stack Coffee app, managing the entire development process from design to deployment. Created a responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and added dynamic functionality with React components for improved reusability. Built the backend with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB for data storage, and implemented user authentication with JWT. Managed database schemas using Mongoose and ensured data integrity with Express-validator. Created and tested APIs, handled CORS for secure machine-specific access, and optimized performance with React hooks like useState, useEffect, and useCallback.
